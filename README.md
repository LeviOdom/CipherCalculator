cipher for coding employee prices or item cost for retail situations.

## Intro
Coded as an exercise for the original programmer. Created for a  
hypothetical company which uses a cipher to display product  
cost of a retail item. Using the displayed code, employee cost  
for the item could be calculated by translating the cipher and  
manually computing the cost the employee would have to pay.  

Changelog will be added to the root of the source code folder and  
linked here.

Some changes will also be listed in the [Changes](#change-history) section  
at the end of this document.

## Features and Scope  
The application will be a fully-functioning calculator that also  
translates prices to a letter-cipher. INROCHDALE stands for the nine  
digits in the Base10 numerical system, 123456789 (i.e. I means 1,  
N means 2, etc.). This cipher was a part of the original use case  
but the cipher can be changed.

Features in initial scope include (in order of priority):
1. Fully functioning calculator
    * adds, subtractcs, divides, and multiplies.
    * formatted for prices (rounded up on decimal to hundredth place,  
        i.e. 102.934 becomes 102.94)
2. Button to translate numbers to letters and vice versa  
3. Graphical interface via web app and/or downloadable executable
4. Help button to explain function and software license.
5. Button to calculate employee cost (typically store cost plus 10%)

Optional features include
* creating a custom cipher and/or employee cost
* calculation history
* doing math with the cipher, instead of numbers
* configuration files which load cipher and/or employee cost settings

### Extended Scope
Optional features will be committed to the working scope below, along  
with the version number corresponding to when the feature began to  
be implemented.

## Change History
All major changes and some minor changes will be listed here, along
